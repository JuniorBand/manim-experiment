Just having fun with manim. This repository contains graphics utilizing ManimGL (the original version from 3b1b: https://github.com/3b1b/manim.git) and ManimCE (the community version: https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim.git). This is relevant to mention, as the two versions differ in syntax and functionalities. I'll put (GL) or (CE) to make it easier to know which is which.

## Space-time (GL)
Using as base the code from https://github.com/Varniex/animations.git. I just adapted it with elliptical orbits for the Earth around the Sun, the Moon around the Earth and the Sun around the barycenter of the Solar System. Here the Earth revolves about 3 times around the Sun and then it gains some kinectic energy that makes the mechanical energy equal to 0, i.e., it makes an orbital tranference to a parabolic orbit.

## Hyperbolic Paraboloid (CE)
Note: This video is in 480p15, since the 1080p60 version is more than 10mb, I can't put it here.
