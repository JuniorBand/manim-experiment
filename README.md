# Space-time

Using as base the code from https://github.com/Varniex/animations.git. I just adapted it with elliptical orbits for the Earth around the Sun, the Moon around the Earth and the Sun around the barycenter of the Solar System. Here the Earth revolves about 3 times around the Sun and then it gains some kinectic energy that makes the mechanical energy is equal to 0, i.e., it makes an orbital tranference to a parabolic orbit.
